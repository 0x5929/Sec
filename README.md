# Sec Repo 

## Git Repo for all things security related, including: 
 1. Enumeration
 2. Exploitation (working progress)
 3. Privilege Escalation
 4. Post-Exploitation (coming soon)
  
  _note:_ \*this repo is for personal pentesting research, educational purposes. Unless stated otherwise, I do not own any of the software hosted in this repository. If you find this repo useful in your pentesting/redteaming engagements or CTF tournaments, awesome; __HOWEVER DO NOT__ use for any illegal/espionage purposes. 
  
  _Still a working progress in building this repo, I will be uploading binaries and scripts as this journey continues._
