# Simple Buffer Overflow POCs

## OSCP Preparation

### When exploiting a simple stack based BoF vulnerability (No ASLR, No DEP, No SEH), we can use the POCs in this folder

**Steps to exploit**

*Note: Please edit scripts' input method if needed, not every program takes the same input format*

1. Always first identify what the service/program is operating on, `linux` or `windows`
	- if `linux`, launch program (if exe file, run with `wine`) and use `edb` as debugger
	- if `windows`, launch program in Windows VM, and use Immunity Debugger as debugger
2. Fuzz the input to test for vulnerability: `fuzz.py` 
3. Send unique patterns (with as many bytes as it took to crash the program with step 1: `pattern.py` (see script to understand how to generate and change the pattern)
4. Find out EIP pattern offset (Hint: also in the `pattern.py` script, using a different ruby script to locate the pattern offset
5. Ensure and confirm that the EIP offset is correct: `eip.py`
6. Sending all hex combinations to see which hex characters program will not process, hence prematurely terminating string: `badchars.py`
7. Find EIP opcode to JMP <reg>, CALL <reg>, PUSH <reg>  RET (Make sure not containing any bad characters)
8. Generate shellcode according to : 
	- OS
	- Arch
	- bad characters
	- encoding (if AV is an issue)
9. Edit the exploit to add in the new shellcode generated in step 8, and exploit: `exploit.py`
